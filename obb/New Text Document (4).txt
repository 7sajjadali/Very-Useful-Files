Yes, you can create an OBB file using the 7-Zip GUI. Here's how to do it:

Step-by-Step Guide to Create an OBB File Using 7-Zip GUI
1. Prepare Your Assets
Create a folder (e.g., assets) that contains all the files you want to package into an OBB.
Example folder structure:
arduino
Copy code
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   └── image2.png
├── videos/
│   └── video1.mp4
└── data/
    └── config.json
2. Install 7-Zip
Download 7-Zip from https://www.7-zip.org/.
Install the program.
3. Compress Files to an OBB Format
Open 7-Zip File Manager:


7z a main.1.com.example.myapp.obb assets

Launch the 7-Zip File Manager application from your Start menu.
Navigate to Your Folder:

Use the 7-Zip interface to browse to the location of your assets folder.
Select the Folder:

Highlight the assets folder.
Add to Archive:

Click on the Add button in the toolbar.
This opens the "Add to Archive" dialog.
Configure Archive Settings:

Archive Name: Set the name of your OBB file, following the format:
php
Copy code

7z a main.1.com.example.myapp.obb assets


main.<versionCode>.<package_name>.obb
Example: main.1.com.example.myapp.obb
Archive Format: Choose zip.
Compression Level: (Optional) Set to "Store" for faster creation or "Normal" for a smaller file size.
Leave other options at their default values.
Click OK:

7-Zip will compress the assets folder into a .zip file.
Rename the File to .obb:

After the compression is complete, rename the resulting .zip file to .obb:
Right-click the file → Rename → Change the extension from .zip to .obb.
4. Test the OBB File
Copy the .obb file to the appropriate directory on your Android device:
bash
Copy code
/Android/obb/<package_name>/
Ensure your app can access and read the OBB file.
Key Notes
The naming convention of the OBB file should follow the format:
php
Copy code
main.<versionCode>.<package_name>.obb
Ensure your Android app has the necessary permissions to read external storage.
