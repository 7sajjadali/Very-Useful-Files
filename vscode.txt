To search for the pattern useEffect{ something }() in VSCode, you can use the following search query:

useEffect\{.*?\}\(\)

Here's how to break it down:

- useEffect: Matches the literal text "useEffect".
- \{: Matches the opening curly brace.
- .*?: Matches any characters (including none) in a non-greedy way.
- \}: Matches the closing curly brace.
- \(: Matches the opening parenthesis.
- \) : Matches the closing parenthesis.

To search for this pattern in VSCode:

1. Open the Find Widget by pressing Ctrl + F (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + F (Mac).
2. Make sure the ".*" button is enabled to toggle regex search on.
3. Paste the search query useEffect\{.*?\}\(\) into the Find input box.
4. Press Enter to start the search.

VSCode will now search for all occurrences of the useEffect hook with any code inside the curly braces, followed by an empty pair of parentheses.
