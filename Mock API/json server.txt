Server
We'll create a simple Node.js server that listens on port 3000 and serves a RESTful API for managing books. We'll use the json-server package to mock a database and provide a RESTful API for books. You can install json-server by running npm install -g json-server.

Then run the following command to start the server:
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
This will start a server at http://localhost:3000 that provides a RESTful API for managing books.



Create a new file named db.json with the following content:

{
  "books": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "The Great Gatsby",
      "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
      "pages": 180
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
      "author": "Harper Lee",
      "pages": 281
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "1984",
      "author": "George Orwell",
      "pages": 328
    }
  ]
}
